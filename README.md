This is the first small practice for me to upload to the github.^^
Congratuate to myself^^

OK!
Let's talk some business!!

I use a TableView and several buttons to design this game.
When user click the number button the number will show on the label below!
After click 4 number-you can just enter 4 numbers:game's rule!!,then click ENTER.
The number you enter will compare with the question that generate when you open the app.
When comparing with the question , if the number and position all be the same with the question that you will get a A.
If just the number be the same with the question but the position , you will get a B!

In conclusion,when you get the 4 A , you win the game^^ 

Enjoy!!
